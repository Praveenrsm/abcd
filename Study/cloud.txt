 5 Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

1.On-demand self-service--a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities,such as server time and network storage,as needed automatically without require human interaction with each service provider.(it will store data automatically no human help)
2.Broad network access--standard mechanism to provide various heterogenous thin or thick platform(mobile,laptop,tablets) 
3.Resource pooling--data where the location was store don't know to customer  and no need 
4.Rapid elasticity--in network data will store elastically using automated process(how much will pay that much storage will get)
5.Measured service-monitored,controlled and reported automatically for both provider and consumer
